It contains two microservices:

**-PassengerData

-Flight_Data**

PassengerDatat is connected to Flight_Data using Feign Client.
I have also implemented rest template object for interconnectivity as an example.

Then, we have added these to microservices to Eureka Server.

After that, I have created the front-end for passenger Details using Angular.
